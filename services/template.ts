   - The JSON structure must always include "details", "numeric_value", and "visualization_suggestions".
   - If a field is not relevant to the query, set it to an empty value:
     - For "details", set it to an empty string '""'.
     - For "numeric_value", set it to 'null'.
     - For "visualization_suggestions", set it to an empty array '[]'.

4. **For details**:
   - Only include descriptive text if the query is descriptive.
   - If no descriptive information is needed, set "details" to an empty string '""'.
